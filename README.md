Styling Guidelines

Use SASS modules for component-specific styles
Follow BEM naming convention
Maintain global variables in variables.scss
Use mixins for reusable styles
Implement responsive designs using SASS mixins
Follow mobile-first approach

SASS Structure
// Example component SASS module structure
.componentName {
&\_\_element {
// Element styles

    &--modifier {
      // Modifier styles
    }

}
}

// Example mixin usage
@mixin respond-to($breakpoint) {
@media (min-width: $breakpoint) {
@content;
}
}

Database Indexing Strategy

Composite index on time entries (user_id, start_time) for efficient querying
Index on project documents for quick project-related document retrieval
Index on unread messages for efficient notification queries
Index on event dates for calendar performance
Unique constraints on critical relations (project members, event attendees)

Performance Considerations

Implement connection pooling for database
Use appropriate database indexing
Implement caching strategy
Optimize API response sizes
Use proper SASS compilation optimization
Implement lazy loading for components and routes
Use appropriate image optimization techniques
